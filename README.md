# Org Chart Generator â€“ Node

## Description

This app builds an org chart html file populated with roles inputting through the command line. It runs on node, using the Inquirer package. On the developer side, there are also tests for the four classes run using Jest.

Building this app was good practice with classes, inquirer, and tests.

## Installation

In the root directory run `npm i` to install dependencies. Then start the app by running `npm index`.

If you'd like to run the tests, run `npm run test` from the root.

## Usage

After starting the app, follow the pormpts in the command line. You'll need to start by entering a manger's information in order to add other employee types to the team.

When you're finished adding employees, an html file will be created in the dist folder.
